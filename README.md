# FigmaClone with AI-Powered Interaction (Planned Project) 🎨🤖

A conceptual framework for building a Figma-inspired collaborative design tool enhanced with AI-powered secondary user interaction. This project aims to merge interactive design tools with cutting-edge AI technologies to create an intelligent, user-friendly platform for designers and creators.

---

## 🌟 Vision

Imagine a design platform where:
- Designers collaborate in real-time to craft stunning visuals and interfaces.
- An AI assistant can autonomously interact with the design environment, performing tasks like aligning elements, resizing layers, or even suggesting improvements.
- The tool is open, extensible, and scalable to accommodate growing user needs.

This project will leverage modern web technologies and AI models like [ShowUI](https://github.com/showlab/ShowUI) to bring this vision to life.

## 🛠️ Planned Features

### Core Design Tool
- **Interactive Canvas**: A dynamic, zoomable, and pannable workspace.
- **Vector Editing**: Tools for creating and editing shapes, text, and images.
- **Layer Management**: Organize and group design elements in hierarchical layers.
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing.

### AI-Powered Interaction
- **Vision-Language Models**: Use AI to interpret the GUI and automate user actions.
- **Natural Language Commands**: Interact with the design tool using text-based instructions.
- **Autonomous Suggestions**: AI-driven design tips, alignment corrections, and layout improvements.

### Extensibility
- **Plugin System**: Enable third-party developers to add custom features.
- **API Access**: Allow integration with other tools and services.

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- **Frontend**: Create a basic interface using React.js and Konva.js for canvas rendering.
- **Backend**: Develop a FastAPI/Django-based server for user authentication and design data storage.
- **Collaboration**: Implement WebSocket-based real-time collaboration.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Add vector editing tools for creating and modifying shapes, text, and layers.
- Implement file save/load features with MongoDB or Firebase for storage.

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- Set up [ShowUI](https://github.com/showlab/ShowUI) as a backend service for AI-based GUI interaction.
- Build a bridge between the AI service and the design tool for real-time vision-language-action tasks.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Enhance the platform with plugins and APIs.
- Optimize performance for large-scale designs and multi-user sessions.

### Phase 5: Launch & Community Building
- Publish the project as open source.
- Build documentation, tutorials, and a demo to encourage community contributions.
